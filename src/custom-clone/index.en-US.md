# Custom Clone


We can pass a function through the `clone` attribute to customize the cloned node, and `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` is used internally to implement cloning. You can also choose to use `lodash` or other third-party libraries. Clone, this function is commonly used in low-code scenarios, such as dragging form elements to the canvas, and a new component element needs to be cloned.

When we use this function, we need to pay attention toï¼š
1. The `pull` attribute in the `group` attribute of the cloned component must be `clone`, otherwise it cannot be cloned.
2. The `name` attribute in the `group` of the cloned component must be consistent with the `name` attribute in the `group` of the cloned component, otherwise it cannot be cloned.

<Alert>
Note: When we use the `clone` attribute, we need to regenerate a unique `key`, otherwise it will cause the component to render abnormally.
