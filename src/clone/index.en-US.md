# Drag Clone


Drag and drop from one list to another list, you can use the `clone` attribute to enable it, internally use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to achieve cloning by default, if you need to pass a custom function, please Use the `clone` attribute to pass the function, and use the method to [customize the clone](../custom-clone/).

When we use this function, we need to pay attention toï¼š
1. The `pull` attribute in the `group` attribute of the cloned component must be `clone`, otherwise it cannot be cloned.
2. The `name` attribute in the `group` of the cloned component must be consistent with the `name` attribute in the `group` of the cloned component, otherwise it cannot be cloned.


<Alert>
  Note: When we use the `clone` attribute, we need to regenerate a unique `key`, otherwise it will cause the component to render abnormally.
</Alert>
